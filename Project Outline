Project Outline:
1. Requirements Analysis
Functional Requirements:
Support for multiple media file formats.
Play, pause and seek functionalities.
Display media information (e.g., duration, format, size).
Non-Functional Requirements:
The player should be user-friendly and responsive.
Ensure low latency during media playback.
Scalable architecture to add more formats as needed.
2. System Design
Architecture Design:
Modular design using the Adapter pattern to handle various media formats.
Component Design:
Media Interface: A common player interface for all media types.
Concrete Media Classes: Different classes for each media format.
Media Adapters: Adapter classes that allow media files to be treated uniformly by the media player.
User Interface Design:
Simple and intuitive GUI that allows users to load, control, and view media files.
3. Implementation
Select a programming language and framework (Java with JavaFX, C# with .NET, etc.).
Implement the MediaInterface and its methods like play, pause, and stop.
Create concrete media classes for each supported format.
Develop adapters for media formats that do not naturally fit the player's interface.
Build the GUI using a suitable framework to handle user interactions.
4. Testing
Unit Testing: Test individual components like adapters and media classes.
Integration Testing: Ensure that adapters work seamlessly with the player interface.
System Testing: Test the application as a whole to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
5. Deployment
Deploy the application on suitable platforms based on the target audience (desktop, web, etc.).
Set up download and installation procedures for desktop versions.
6. Maintenance
Regular updates for supporting new media formats.
Performance enhancements and bug fixes based on user feedback.
Additional Features
Playlist Management: Users can create and manage playlists of their favorite media.
Streaming Support: Extend the player to support streaming media from the internet.
Audio and Video Effects: Integrate effects such as equalizers for audio and filters for video.
